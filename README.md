# README

There are very few things to cover.

This project is heavily based on the project found at the following link:
https://github.com/spkdroid/CRUD-RubyOnRails

Changes made from that project was adding an additional piece of data to the database table: 'status'
Which is a string value, could have been made to be a boolean, that details whether the task has been completed or not

As well as having added some CSS classes and adding DIV elements with the CSS classes to make the project 
look much more readable and user friendly.
